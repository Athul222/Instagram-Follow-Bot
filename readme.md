# Instagram Follow Bot

## Objective

I know it sucks every time you need to click the add friend option to add them as friend, but from now onwards don't worry. I have created a instagram bot using python/selenium to automate the work of following the people on instagram.  

## Setup

1. **Install Python:**
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - To work with the packages, you have to install them. You can do this by using the command prompt or terminal.
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
   - Execute the Python script using the following command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
     If you're using Python 3, use `python3` instead:
     ```bash
     python3 main.py
     ```
